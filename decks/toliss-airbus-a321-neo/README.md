# Cockpitdecks Configuration File for Toliss Airbus A321 with neo Option

This is a collection of button definition for several deck and deck models.
It exhibit most, if not all, capabilities of Cockpitdecks.

It is the main development configuration for several deck models.

It may be necessary to do some adjustment to get a "production" layout.
(I will later refine this configuration, from its "development" status that
exhibit most features, to a production version that it tailored for this aircraft only.)

The hardest part is dataref hunting.


It may work on other Toliss Airbus aicrafts (A319, A320, A330neo, A340) with adjustments.
(I do not own them, so I cannot test...)
